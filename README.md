# YOLO 5 Bike Lane Hole Detector

## Overview

This project utilizes YOLO 5 to detect holes in bike lanes. The algorithm was trained on a custom dataset created by cycling through Curitiba, Brazil, to capture various types of bike lane holes.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLO 5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify and localize holes in bike lanes.
- **Custom Dataset**: Created a comprehensive dataset by cycling through Curitiba, capturing diverse instances of bike lane holes.
- **Algorithm Development**: Developed and fine-tuned the detection algorithm to accurately pinpoint and classify different types of holes.
